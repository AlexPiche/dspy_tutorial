        "text_1": "Based on the given measurements, the quadrilateral in question is a rectangle. This is because a rectangle is a quadrilateral with two sets of opposite sides that are equal in length. In the given case, the sides of length 6cm and 8cm, and the other 6cm and 8cm, are equal in length, and therefore this figure is a rectangle.\n\nThe diagonals of the rectangle also provide additional evidence of the figure being a rectangle. If the diagonals of a quadrilateral are equal, its opposite angles are also equal, and it is called a rectangle. In this case, the diagonals of the rectangle are 10cm and 12cm, which are indeed equal.\n\nFinally, we can also confirm the measurement by calculating the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length of one of its sides by its corresponding height. For rectangle sides measuring 6cm and 8cm, respectively, with diagonals measuring 10cm and 12cm, we can calculate the area as (6 \u00d7 8) cm\u00b2 = 48 cm\u00b2, and the perimeter as 4(6 + 8) cm = 48 cm. As 48 is equal to the area and the perimeter of the rectangle, our identification of the rectangle is confirmed.\n\nIn summary, using the given measurements, it is clear that the quadrilateral in question is indeed a rectangle. Its sides are equal, and the diagonals provide evidence of the quadrilateral being a rectangle. Finally, we can confirm the identification by calculating the area and perimeter of the rectangle.",
