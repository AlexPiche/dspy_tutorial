        "text_1": "There are several rules for exponents that make mathematical operations easier to perform. Here are four fundamental rules for working with exponents:\n\n1. Product rule: When you multiply two expressions with the same base, you add their exponents. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n\na^m * a^n = a^(m+n)\n\nFor example, 2^3 * 2^2 = 2^(3+2) = 2^5 = 32\n\n2. Quotient rule: When you divide two expressions with the same base, you subtract the exponent of the denominator from the exponent of the numerator. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n\na^m \/ a^n = a^(m-n)\n\nFor example, 3^5 \/ 3^2 = 3^(5-2) = 3^3 = 27\n\n3. Power of a power rule: When you raise an exponentiated expression to another exponent, you multiply the exponents. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n\n(a^m)^n = a^(m*n)\n\nFor example, (2^3)^2 = 2^(3*2) = 2^6 = 64\n\n4. Zero exponent rule: Any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n\na^0 = 1 (where a \u2260 0)\n\nFor example, 5^0 = 1\n\nThese four rules are essential for simplifying and manipulating expressions involving exponents. Keep in mind that there are more rules such as negative exponents and distribution rule, which are also useful when working with exponents.",
