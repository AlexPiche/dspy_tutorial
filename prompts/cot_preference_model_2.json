        "text_1": "Some lesser-known authors from Shakespeare's time worth exploring include John Heywood, Thomas Middleton, and Christopher Marlowe. Heywood was a prolific writer of shorter plays, and his works have some remarkable similarities to those of Shakespeare. Middleton and Marlowe were both prominent Renaissance dramatists who wrote similar works to those of Shakespeare, with a focus on mythic and historical subjects. They also explored topics such as love, religion, and politics in a way that mirrors Shakespeare's style. These three authors are a good place to start for those looking to explore lesser-known authors from Shakespeare's time.",
        "text_2": "There were many talented writers during Shakespeare's era, some of whom may be less well-known than he is today. Here are a few writers from his time period whom you could explore:\n\n1. Ben Jonson: A contemporary of Shakespeare, Jonson wrote numerous plays that are still performed today, including \"Volpone\" and \"The Alchemist.\"\n2. Philip Massinger: A playwright who wrote both comedies and tragedies, Massinger was known for his complicated plots and intricate characters.\n3. John Fletcher: A prolific playwright, Fletcher collaborated with Massinger on several plays and also wrote many successful plays on his own, including \"The Faithful Shepherdess.\"\n4. John Webster: A writer of dark, violent plays, Webster is known for his tragic writing style and his exploration of human brutality.\n\nThese are just a few examples of lesser-known writers of the time. There were many others who contributed to the literary scene during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, and who might be worth exploring if you have an interest in the literature of Shakespeare's time.",
        "rationale": "produce the preferred text. We need to identify the lesser-known authors from Shakespeare's time who are worth exploring. We can start by considering the authors who were contemporaries of Shakespeare and who wrote plays that are still performed today. We can also look at the authors who wrote plays that are similar in style and theme to those of Shakespeare. Finally, we can explore the authors who wrote plays that are less well-known but still worth reading.",

        "text_1": "The formula for calculating the minimum score required to pass a test with 15 questions and a passing score of 80% is as follows:\n\nP = number of questions passed (rounded to the nearest integer)\nn = total number of questions\nd = the difference between the student's score and the passing score\n\nP = floor(n(0.8) + 0.5) + 1\n\nwhere 0.8 is the minimum percentage required to pass, and the floor function is used to round down to the nearest integer.\n\nSo the formula in latex format is,\n\n`P = floor(n(0.8) + 0.5) + 1`\n\nHere n represents the total number of questions which is 15 in this case. So the minimum score required to pass the test is 13. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\n`P = floor(15(0.8) + 0.5) + 1`\n\n`= floor(12.0 + 0.5) + 1`\n\n`= 12 + 1`\n\n`= 13`\n\nTherefore, the minimum score required to pass the exam with 15 questions and a passing score of 80% is 13.",
