Convert 150 units of Currency A to Currency B:\n150 units of Currency A are equivalent to 135 units of Currency B.\n2. Convert 135 units of Currency B to Currency C:\nWe know that 1 unit of Currency B is worth 0.8 units of Currency C. To convert 135 units of Currency B to Currency C, we will multiply 135 by 0.8:\n\n135 \\* 0.8 = 108 units of Currency C\n3.
